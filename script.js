/* **************************************** */
// 1. Polyfills
/* **************************************** */

// A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.

// A. Let's implement it for map
// this - array
// this[i] - current value

Array.prototype.myMap = function(cb) {
  var arr = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    arr.push(cb(this[i], i, this));
    console.log(this[i]); // Expected 1, 2, 3
  }

  return arr;
};

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const newCB = a => a * 2;

// console.log(arr.myMap(newCB));
//Expected [2, 4, 6];

// B. bind

let name = {
  first: 'Princess',
  last: 'Gurung'
};

let display = function() {
  console.log(`She is ${this.first} ${this.last}.`);
};

Function.prototype.myBind = function(...args) {
  //this -> display
  let obj = this;
  return function() {
    obj.call(args[0]);
  };
};

// let displayMe = display.bind(obj)

let displayMe = display.myBind(name);

// displayMe(); //Expected: She is Princess Gurung.

// C. With some parameters

let displayMore = function(city, country) {
  console.log(`${this.first} ${this.last} from ${city}, ${country}`);
};

Function.prototype.yourBind = function(...args) {
  let obj = this;
  //get the args except the first one
  params = args.slice(1);
  return function(...args2) {
    obj.apply(args[0], [...params, ...args2]);
  };
};

let displayYou = displayMore.yourBind(name, 'KTM');
// displayYou('Nepal'); //Expected: Princess Gurung from KTM, Nepal

/* **************************************** */
//2. CLOSURES
/* **************************************** */

// Function bundled together with its lexical environment forms a closure

// what is lexical environment❓

// It is essentially the surrounding state - the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent.

function x() {
  var a = 7;
  function y() {
    console.log(a);
  }

  return y;
}

var z = x();
// console.log(z); //Expected: [ Function: y]
// z();   // Expected: 7;

// When x is invoked, y is returned. Now, y is waiting to be executed. Kind of like a loaded gun waiting to be shot! 🔫

// So, when we finally invoke z - y is invoked. Now, y has to log a so it first tries to find 🔍 it in the local memory but it's not there. It goes to its parent function. It finds a there.

// Voila❗There you have it - this is closure.

// Even when functions are returned (in the above case y) they still remember their lexical scope (where it came from)

/* **************************************** */
// 3. Currying
/* **************************************** */

let add = function(x) {
  return function(y) {
    console.log(x + y);
  };
};

let addByTwo = add(2);
// console.log(addByTwo);  //Expected: [Function: y]
// addByTwo(3);  //Expected: 5;

/* **************************************** */
// 4. Data Hiding / Encapsulation
/* **************************************** */

//  Suppose, you want to create a counter application. Every time, you call it - the count increases by 1. But you don't want to expose the variable outside the function. How to do it?

// You guessed it - closure❗

function Counter() {
  var count = 0;
  this.incrementCount = function() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

// console.log(count); //Error:count is not defined;

var adder = new Counter();
// adder.incrementCount();  //1;

// Disadvantages 😅
// Overconsumption of memory or memory leaks can happen.
// For example, the closed-over-variable will not be garbage collected. As even if the outer function has run, the returned inner function still has a reference to the closed-over-variable.

// Note: Garbage collector basically removes unused variables from the memory automatically.

/* **************************************** */
// 5. 🤝Promises
/* **************************************** */

// The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

// It is in one of these three states:

// pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected
// fulfilled: operation was completed successfully
// rejected: operation failed

const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let value = true;

  if (value) {
    resolve('hey value is true');
  } else {
    reject('There was an error, value is false');
  }
});

// A. Then / Catch
promise
  .then(x => {
    console.log(x);
  })
  .catch(error => console.log(error));

// Expected: hey value is true

// Note: resolve and reject are just conventional names. Call it pizza🍕 if you like

// B. Async / Await

// Instead of then/catch - we can also use async/await

async function asyncCall() {
  const result = await promise;
  console.log(result);
}

// asyncCall(); // Expected: hey value is true

// One of the advantages of promises is that it is a much cleaner syntax. Earlier, it used to be a callback hell 🌋

/* **************************************** */
// 6. 👪 Prototypes, Prototypal Inheritance
/* **************************************** */

// A.
// Whenever we create anything (object, function) in JS - JS Engine automatically attaches that anything with some properties and methods

// All this comes via prototypes

// __proto__ is the object where JS is putting it all

let array = ['yug', 'yoog'];

// console.log(array.__proto__.forEach); // Expected: ƒ forEach() { [native code] }

// console.log(array.__proto__); //same as Array.prototype:  concat, constructor, every, fill, filter, find, forEach, join, map, keys, pop, push .....

// console.log(array.__proto__.__proto__); // same as Object.prototype:constructor: hasOwnProperty, isPrototypeOf, toLocaleString, toString, valueOf, get __proto__, set __proto__ ......

// console.log(array.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__); //null

// All this is called a prototype chain

// We can do the same with objects and functions as well.

// We will always find Object.prototype behind the scenes. That's why you may have heard - everything in JS is nothing but an object 🤯

// B.
let object = {
  name: 'Princess',
  city: 'PKR',
  getIntro: function() {
    console.log(`${this.name}, ${this.city}`);
  }
};

// Note: Don't modify prototypes this way. It's just for understanding.

let object2 = {
  name: 'Prince'
};

// The right way to do it: https://javascript.plainenglish.io/how-prototypal-inheritance-works-in-javascript-and-how-to-convert-it-to-class-based-inheritance-632e31e6350d

object2.__proto__ = object;

// By doing this, object2 gets access to the object's properties. So, now we can do:

// console.log(object2.city); // Expected: PKR

// This is prototypal inheritance.

// C. Coming back to the polyfill of bind from previous myBind (line 46):

Function.prototype.myBind = function() {
  // code...
};

// now we can access this method whenever we create a new function
function a() {
  // code
}

// console.log(a.__proto__) // will have myBind method

// 7. ⚡Performance Optimization

// DEBOUNCING
// A.

const inputField = document.getElementById('text');
const resultField = document.getElementById('result');
const outputField = document.getElementById('output');

const getData = e => {
  resultField.innerText = e.target.value;
  outputField.style.visibility = 'visible';
  console.log(e.target.value);
};

const debounce = function(fn, delay) {
  let timer;
  return function() {
    let context = this;
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => {
      fn.apply(context, arguments);
    }, delay);
  };
};

inputField.addEventListener('keyup', debounce(getData, 300));
// Inside the debounce function, we create a timer function using setTimeout which is responsible to call next getData() only after 300ms. This is debouncing.

// B.
function countDown(count) {
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    function timer() {
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(count);
        count--;
      }, i * 500);
    }

    timer(i);
  }
}

// countDown(10);

// this function prints 10, 9, 8, ... with some delay in between that is debouncing.

// 8. Throttling

// For example, on every window resize event, we call an expensive function. Now, we want it such that the expensive function will only be executed once in the given time interval.
// This is what throggling is.

const expensive = () => {
  console.log('expensive');
};

const throttle = (fn, limit) => {
  let context = this;
  let flag = true;
  return function() {
    if (flag) {
      fn.apply(context, arguments);
      flag = false;
    }

    setTimeout(() => {
      flag = true;
    }, limit);
  };
};

const func = throttle(expensive, 2000);
// window.addEventListener('resize', func);

// Only when flag variable is true, we are invoking the callback function. And it is set to true inside the setTimeout. So, it is true only after desired time limit.

// So, what's the difference between debounce and throttling❓

// Let's take the search bar 🔍 example from above. When we are debouncing the input field - we are saying that only fetch the data when the difference between two keyup events is at least 300 ms.

// In the case of throttling, we make a function call only after a certain period of time. Suppose, you are searching for an encyclopedia in the search bar. Say, the first call is made on e and it took us 300 ms to reach p. The next call will be made then only. All the events in between will be ignored.

// So, to summarize, debouncing - when the difference between two keyup events is 300 ms and throttling - when the difference between two function calls is 300 ms. Basically, the function is called after a certain interval of time.
